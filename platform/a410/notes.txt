Camera depending notes: 

- A410 uses Propset 1 of Properties (see http://tinyurl.com/6zbv9b)
- The A410 does not have an iris diaphragm, it has a smaller snap-in aperture (not an ND filter)
  Seen this in a dismantled A430 optics, suspect the same in at least the A410 - A430 models.
  The CHDK controls this the same as an ND-filter.

Changelog

Beta 5, 2011-08-07
- manual focus / subject distance override is now possible (disabled an assert that caused the shutdown)
  note: this does not include af-scan in video (which would be too much work to fix)
- movie time limit increase was tested, it's no longer "experimental"

Beta 4, 2011-07-28
- experimental change: movie time limit increased to 60 minutes / recording in 320x240, 640x480 modes
  tested in both modes, resulting files show no sign of corruption

Beta 3, 2011-07-11
- modemap is now correct
- USB remote should work

Beta 2, 2011-07-06
- optical data corrected, aperture display is now correct

Beta 1, 2011-07-03

- based on A430/A610/A530/..., thanks to the authors of those ports
- USB completely untested, don't know if it works or not, A430 stuff without change
- optics stuff based on A450
  3.2x zoom (41-131mm eqv.), 5.4-17.3mm, F2.8-5.1 1/3.2" CCD (-> A410, A420, A450 might use very similar optical units)
- probably incorrect color profile for this CCD
- "circle of confusion" may be incorrect for this sensor

- RAW/DNG works, RAW not recognized by popular software (DNG4PS2 can handle it when configured by hand)
- RAW/DNG file numbers should work (not tested extensively)
- extra long exposures are enabled, shutter speed override works (even with display off)
- flash adjustment seems to work
- zebra works
- grids should work, but not tested yet
- histogram works
- "ND filter" (see above) control works, DOF-change confirmed
- no manual focusing or subject distance override possible

- movie mode works, 1G filesize limit removed (impossible to reach, because of the 180 sec time limit)
- no AF scan possible during movie recording, so it is disabled (would crash the camera)
- movie exposure override sometimes works, sometimes not
- video compression override works
- optical zoom works during movie recording


Bugs:

x [fixed] Aperture (F) display (while half-shooting) often missing, displays "?" (when draw exposition is active)
- camera functions got frozen (no shutdown!) once while experimenting with overrides/chdk controls... can't reproduce
There might be other bugs, use it with caution.

Camera specific CHDK behaviour:

- enabling both "video quality control" and "enable optical zoom" in the "video parameters" submenu is not recommended
  pressing the up/down buttons would zoom AND change compression quality at the same time

RAW:

4Pack of Simple CHDK Scripts
============================

Presented here are four simple scripts for Canon cameras using CHDK.  
Each script is available in both the Lua and uBasic programming language. 
Make sure you have your camera in "shooting mode" prior to activating these scripts.

They are :

1) shoot.bas & shoot.lua
       - a very simple script that simply takes a picture after a configurable time delay

2) interval.bas & interval.lua
       - a script to continuously take pictures at a configurable time interval
	   
3) motion.bas & motion.lua
       - a motion detection script - takes one picture when motion is detected 
	   
4) hdr.bas & hdr.lua
       - a script for taking images used in high dynamic range pictures 
	   - also called exposure bracketing
	   - takes three picture - one correctly exposed, one overexposed and one underexposed
	   
Obviously these are very simple program and you are encouraged to modify and expand them to suit your needs.
